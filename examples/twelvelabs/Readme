# TwelveLabs Video Memory Pipeline

## Setup

1. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Ingesting Video Chunks

Run `pipeline.py` to process a 6-second video chunk. This script will:
- Generate 3 embeddings (video, text, audio) using TwelveLabs
- Insert the embeddings into Pinecone

```bash
python pipeline.py
```

### Querying Memories

Run `query.py` to ask questions about your video memories:

```bash
python query.py "What happened in the kitchen?"
```

Or run it interactively:
```bash
python query.py
```

BE CAREFUL NOT TO USE CREDITS, JUST USE 1 SIX SECOND CHUNK AT A TIME
